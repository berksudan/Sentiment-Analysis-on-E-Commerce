	1. <<did not could not use this purchased then received decal a month later came in two parts one poster with the actual decal other poster with the adhesive there was no plausible way to get this decal to stick to wall very unsatisfied with product zero stars>>
	2. <<this does not arrive in a usable format it is unbelievably complicated each little dot is a separate sticker waste of money>>
	3. <<waste of money it came all bunched up then you have to use transferring paper that was to small and didnt work wasnt strong enough to even pull wall decals off to stick to wallasked for a refund and they said we will resend you one what to wait a month for the same crap thanks for nothing>>
	4. <<this is not one big sticker its a million pieces>>
	5. <<came in a thousand little pieces and impossible to hang without cutting it it would take hours to get it like the picture not worth it>>
	6. <<this was garbagewound up throwing it away it came all smashed up and was unable to peel it off the backing and part was ripped dont waste your money on this>>
	7. <<i loved the design but i was not able to remove the sticker from the transfer paper successfully the decal ripped several times and looked awful it was cheap and you get what you pay for i do not recommend this product>>
	8. <<i threw it away>>
	9. <<this item has extreme directions it is not an easy slap on the wall decal the cost was not enough to make it worth the hour tedious process to get it on the wall>>
	10. <<i love this product a lot a little tricky to useoverall looks nice>>
	11. <<extremely small>>
	12. <<hard to apply>>
	13. <<i wish i read the instructions before trying to put it on i messed it up you have to basically laminate it with another piece before trying to put it on the wall this sticker should come with less assembly required i did not want a diy project just a sticker>>
	14. <<waaay smaller than the photo portrays i should have looked at the dimensions first it does not come with on transfer paper either so if you are going to put it on the wall you will have to purchase transfer paper no wonder it was so cheap i know better>>
	15. <<really hard to put up and then immediately fell off the wall i tried to scotch tape a few parts but it looked like garbage dont order this also its tiny the pictures are a lie its like not even feet tall>>
	16. <<its actually not nearly as big as the pics show so beware the design also has folds that perpetually keep parts of it unflush with the wall but from most angles where i have it its pretty neat just a bit subpar to its own promotion>>
	17. <<i would suggest shipping in a hard tube i came wrinkled and application is a bit confusing>>
	18. <<not nearly as large as advertised still pretty but smaller than it should be you have to read instructions before applying otherwise itll get ruined>>
