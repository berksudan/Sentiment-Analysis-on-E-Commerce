There was no plausible way to get this decal to stick to wall. Very unsatisfied with product. Zero stars!",0.0
2,B071H38K22,"2017-10-05",1,22,"This does not arrive in a usable format, it is unbelievably complicated. Each little dot is a separate sticker. Waste of money.",-0.5
3,B071H38K22,"2018-08-19",1,58,"Waste of money!!! It came all bunched up then you have to use transferring paper that was to small and didnt work wasn't strong enough to even pull wall decals off to stick to wall...asked for a refund and they said we will resend you one ...what to wait a month for the same crap! Thanks for nothing!",0.3333333333333333

7,B071H38K22,"2018-03-01",1,44,"I loved the design, but I was not able to remove the sticker from the transfer paper successfully. The decal ripped several times and looked awful.  It was cheap and you get what you pay for.  I do not recommend this product.",0.0

9,B071H38K22,"2018-04-07",1,35,"This item has extreme directions. It is not an easy slap on the wall decal. The cost was not enough to make it worth the 2 hour tedious process to get it on the wall.",0.2

13,B071H38K22,"2017-08-19",3,51,"I wish I read the instructions before trying to put it on, I messed it up. You have to basically laminate it with another piece before trying to put it on the wall. This sticker should come with less assembly required. I did not want a DIY project just a sticker.",-1.0
14,B071H38K22,"2018-01-30",3,50,"WAAAY smaller than the photo portrays. I should have looked at the dimensions first. It does not come with on transfer paper either. So if you are going to put it on the wall you will have to purchase transfer paper. No wonder it was so cheap. I know better.",0.3333333333333333
15,B071H38K22,"2017-12-13",1,43,"Really hard to put up and then immediately fell off the wall I tried to scotch tape a few parts but it looked like garbage. Don't order this. Also it's tiny the pictures are a lie it's like not even 2 feet tall",-0.3333333333333333
16,B071H38K22,"2018-04-17",2,46,"Itâ€™s actually not nearly as big as the pics show, so beware. The design also has folds that perpetually keep parts of it unflush with the wall. But from most angles where I have it, itâ€™s pretty neat. Just a bit subpar to its own promotion.",0.3333333333333333
